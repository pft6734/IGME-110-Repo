# The Adeptus Mechanicus
"From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the blessed machine. Your kind cling to your flesh as if it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass you call a temple will wither and you will beg my kind to save you. But I am already saved. For the Machine is Immortal"

The **Adeptus Mechanicus**, often abbreviated to the **Admech**, is a playable faction in the tabletop wargame and universe of Warhammer 40k. Based in the Forge World of Mars, this semi-independent organization provides the Imperium of Man with all the advanced technology required to run an galaxy-spanning empire. However, much like the rest of the Imperium, its tech-priest elites infight constantly, jealously guarding their discoveries, which they view as sacred wisdom of the Omnissiah, from their peers.
